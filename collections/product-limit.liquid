  title: Product limit
  description: A product limit sets a limit on the number of products rendered on a single page. This example demonstrates how to limit the number of products that show per collection page. Learn more about product limits in the [Shopify Help Center](https://help.shopify.com/en/themes/customization/collections/show-more-products-on-collection-pages).

  step_1: Place the paginate tags around a `forloop`, that loops through products within a collection.
  step_2: Replace `limit` with the number of products you wish to show per page on the collection.

{% paginate collection.products by limit %}
