# Liquid Library
#### Build and customize themes faster with Shopifyâ€™s Liquid Library

This library provides practical code examples that illustrate best practices to build reliable and accessible themes. Use the library to learn Liquid, onboard new team members, and jump start your development on Shopify!

**Please note:** We have intentionally limited CSS and JavaScript, and removed translation strings in order to keep these examples compatible with any theme. Any CSS we have included is for accessibility or rendering purposes.

### <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/liquid-library-examples/tree/master/blog">Blog</a>

A Shopify online store comes with a built-in blogging engine. Blogging is a great way for merchants to build their audience and generate more traffic and sale for their business. These examples provide a starting point to begin building various components of a blog. This includes individual blog posts, blog article listings, comments, tags, and more.

These examples showcase some page templates that render outside of the typical scope of products, pages, and collections, as well as header logo, social media metadata, customer links, accepted payments, and more.
